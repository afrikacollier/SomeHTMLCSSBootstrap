    <h2>Music</h2><br>
<p><strong>Posted</strong> by <strong>Afrika Collier</strong> at Thursday, October 24, 2019 11:56:55 PM <br>
I usually don’t really listen to music but when I do I prefer it silent. I do appreciate the music <br>
that gives the feel of community. Whenever there are people jumping, swinging their hips, or stomping <br>
their feet it gives off a feeling of community. Sometimes I even want to join in the dancing. The music <br>
that makes you want to dance regardless of whether you can or not. The music that you hear out on the <br>
streets. Sometimes maybe it's a little humming noise that I heard walking downtown. Sometimes it’s not <br>
even necessarily the words but the soul put into the sound of the beat and rhythm. Then it can also be <br>
that wholesome sound in church. Where some long notes are stretched out on an organ. There’ s even <br>
traditional dances danced to traditional music. One friend from Georgia (not the state) was showing me <br>
a YouTube video of a traditional folk dance that people did throughout the city of Georgia. There’s even <br>
a periodical made by some folk in California with nothing else to do called “Folk Dance Scene” listing <br>
different folk dances around the country. They even teach people how to dance at their group meetings. <br>
I suppose dancing wouldn’t come as something I enjoy watching and doing sometimes if it wasn’t for the <br>
joy of music. This music bringing about community. Music is always something that’s shared. You don’t go <br>
into a store and ask for earphones and they only give you one earbud. Earphones always come with two <br>
earbuds whether you like it or not. However, I guess music can also be for yourself. Sometimes I hear <br>
my mom making up her own lyrics “just because”. Other times, my mom and I would be on a road trip <br>
listening to music together and then start making are own lyrics about anything and everything. Music <br>
is meant to bring about community. In the church growing up there was praise dance. Our <br>
long-outstretched arms were used to convey a meaning a long with our large dramatic performance. <br>
Whether that meaning was actually any meaning at all was up to how the music led you to feel in that <br>
moment. I always really enjoyed this. Or the times at the Kroc center where the kids would beat on <br>
 drums to make their own meanings of the music was enjoyable when they beat the drums with rhythm but <br>
 of course five year olds have their own since of rhythm. <br>
