    <h2>Dew Drops</h2><br>
<strong>Posted</strong> by <strong>Afrika Collier</strong> at Thursday, September 5, 2019 10:55:08 PM <br>
A hint of grey and black and white make up the subtle tone of the picture <br>
“Drops of Dew”. Water paints onto the canvas (the leaf) like sprinkles on ice cream, <br>
thus, creating an illusory image and mystery behind perhaps the many thoughts <br>
that can be derived. The image is mysterious but simple. It does it’s due as nature <br>
allows rain to drop from the clouds to sprinkle on the ice cream. Later the sprinkles <br>
evaporate and return to the sky to repeat their cycle. Veins of life are spread across <br>
the smooth surface of the leaf. Reminding me of how the blood courses through the body <br>
to bring about our own life. The large drops and the small drops, the drops that both <br>
smear and dampen can all be found on the leaf to tear or heal, I do not know. I do know <br>
the sun rises and the stars fall. The larger the drop the faster they fall while the <br>
smaller the drop the more they’ll rise one day. The cycle repeats and the smaller drops <br>
will continue to be the nourishment for the leaf. While the larger drops that fall will <br>
be replaced. Capitalism always runs that way. Unlike sprinkles— whose color may differ <br>
but size remain relatively the same— dew drops may have large and small drops. Perhaps, <br>
they represent they represent the rich and the poor, but in the end, does it matter anymore. <br>
They all go back to the same cycle: to rinse, to survive, to repeat, and to hopefully <br>
live out the rest of their lives. <br>
The small may make up the larger of the dew drops, while the large make up the smaller. <br>
However, the essence of the larger (money) make up the majority while the smaller continue <br>
to have the same fate. The smaller repeat the cycle. Some may combine and become conglomerates <br>
but others may have the same fate as some other Big Companies and fall all the same off the <br>
leaf. Sometimes I wonder why there are not more leaves. Can leaves change? Can one dew drop hop <br>
on to a non-existing leaf? Or is there one of government for the people and this government for all? <br>
However, dew drops are different, leaves are different but there is only one leaf. Can the leaf <br>
die? Can it wither and wilt? Will it cease to exist? Can a stranger walk by and step on it? <br>
What happens then? <br>
After all, this leaf does not have a name. It’s not stamped as democracy, republic, communism, <br>
autocracy, or fascism. Regardless of the unknown the leaf remains the same. The picture will <br>
keep its dismal look will never change. The photographer will stay behind the lens and pretend <br>
he knows what he thought when he took the picture hoping that other people will understand. <br>
The photographer could also think there are multiple interpretations and not a single one is <br>
correct or wrong. What’s good for one may not be good for the other. The dismal look, the may <br>
drops as sprinkles or sprinkles as drops may never really be understood. For there are different <br>
colors, different classes (the rich and the poor), and different governments in high time these all <br>
give rise to different cycles. <br>
