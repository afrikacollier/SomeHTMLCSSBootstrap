    <h2>Greatest Fear</h2> <br>
<strong>Posted</strong> by <strong>Afrika Collier</strong> at Thursday, October 10, 2019 11:56:16 PM <br>
          My greatest fear after college is not being able to find a job that I want. I originally <br>
           wanted to do app development but everything seems so competitive lately. Everybody says <br>
           that you need more and more education as the years go by in order to get the position that <br>
           you want. In the past there used to be apprenticeships and you learned from a master or <br>
           something. However, nowadays you need a degree then another degree to prove that your <br>
           invaluable for the position. There are still internships available but the internships <br>
           seem to be getting more and more competitive. It makes me wonder whether there are enough <br>
           people filling the positions since there’s such a thing as people being underqualified to <br>
           do the different positions, and therefore, leaves vacancy. However, is there enough room for <br>
           qualified people to teach what the world deems underqualified people? Does school ever really <br>
           teach you everything you need to know? I think there is always room for improvement. What if <br>
           someone is book smart but not necessarily paper smart? This can also be the case for many <br>
           people. Some people just suck at taking tests and it is not exactly a good representation <br> 
           of their ability. I know for one thing, one trig/pre-cal exam sophomore year of high school <br>
           I got 100% on half of the test. I only managed to attempt half of the test. Working a job <br>
           seems different than actually being in school. These instances I felt in the library. If I <br>
           have a question that I do not know, I just ask someone who does. Same thing if someone has <br>
           a question they do not know, they just ask me or whoever else knows. <br>
           Though I do have other fears such as not eating a meal everyday -- starving because I couldn’t even get <br>
           a job at McDonalds. Not being able to afford a car or a livelihood. What if one day I wind up on the <br>
           side of the road with no food, water, or clothes on my back. This all ties into not being able to find <br>
            a job in the end. What if the apartment I live in turns out to be a hole that I’ll never be able to <br>
            crawl out? There could be water dripping from the ceilings fall on my bed. I might have to move the <br>
            bed but there are more water drippings from the spot I moved the bed too. Then I have to put buckets <br>
            on the floor and buckets on top of the bed. Then ask the landlord whether they can fix the ceiling <br>
            but the landlord pretends there busy and no one comes to help after several months. Then my parents <br>
            find me, after several years of not communicating because I don’t want to tell them all my dreams <br>
            and aspirations and their expectations have all went down the drain of the garbage disposal. That <br>
            is what I’m afraid of becoming the garbage disposal. <br>
